This story is a textbook example of "telling" instead of "showing," and it suffers from a lack of dynamic dialogue and character development.  Here's a brutally honest critique to help you make this story truly terrifying:

**Chapter 1: The Invitation**

* **Descriptive Overload:**  You're drowning the reader in descriptions.  Instead of saying the wind "howled like a banshee," show us the effect. What does the wind *do*? Does it rattle the windows, tear at his hair, carry a scent of salt? Instead of "icy fingers clawing at the windows," describe how the windows tremble, or how the frost patterns on the glass resemble claws.  
* **"Show, Don't Tell" about Elias:** We know Elias is depressed and struggling to write, but you're *telling* us.  Show us his empty bottle, the crumpled pages in his trash, the blank notebook lying open on his desk. Show us him struggling to form words, or pacing the room in frustration. 
* **Generic Dialogue:** "You are Elias," she said. "You know my name."  This dialogue is bland and predictable.  Give her a more intriguing introduction. What is it about her presence that makes Elias uneasy? Is there a  tension in her voice, a hint of something sinister?
* **The Muse is a Mystery:** You introduce her as "The Muse," which is a bit on the nose.  What is she? What does she want? Why is she drawn to Elias?  Give us more than just the word "Muse,"  give us hints about her intentions.

**Chapter 2: The Story**

* **Passive Storytelling:** The story feels like a summary. You're *telling* us what happens, not *showing* it.  Instead of "The Shadowman emerged from the shadows," describe what he *looks* like, how he moves, the sound he makes. What is it about him that makes Elias feel threatened?
* **Where's the Conflict?**  The narrative lacks tension.  The Shadowman and The Siren are just described, they aren't actively pursuing anything.  Where is the conflict between them?  Is The Siren trying to escape The Shadowman? Is Elias tempted by The Siren?
* **Bland Dialogue:** The dialogue is flat and predictable.  Instead of "You have told me your story," give us a line that reveals something about The Muse's nature. Is she pleased with the story? Does she want more?  Give us a hint of the price Elias is paying for telling this story.

**Chapter 3: The Price**

* **The Price is Too Abstract:**  The "price" of Elias' story is his sanity, but you're not showing us how this happens.  Instead of saying the characters are "real,"  show us how the mansion is changing, how the characters are interacting with Elias, how his perceptions are shifting. 
* **No Character Growth:** Elias is a passive observer in his own story. He's reacting to things but not acting on them. Give him a goal, an inner conflict, or a desperate attempt to break free.  What are his fears? How does he fight back?
* **The Ending is Weak:**  The ending is vague and unsatisfying.   Where is Elias now? What happened to him?  What does his fate reveal about the story's power?  Leave the reader with a lingering sense of dread, not just a shrug.

**Overall:** This story has potential.  You have a good premise, but you need to dive deeper into the characters' motivations,  show us the story's impact on Elias, and let the tension build slowly.  Use evocative language to create a vivid and unsettling atmosphere. 

**Here are some specific suggestions:**

* **Focus on sensory details:**  Instead of describing the wind as "howling," describe the sound it makes, the way it whips at Elias' clothes, the smell of salt in the air. 
* **Give us a villain's voice:**  The Muse and the Shadowman need to have a distinctive voice.  What do they say?  What are their motivations? 
* **Create stakes:**  What is at stake for Elias?  What will he lose if he can't escape the story? 
* **Don't tell us, show us:**  Instead of saying Elias is depressed, show us his empty bottle, his blank notebook, his frustrated pacing.  Show us the effects of the story on his mind.

Remember, the goal is to create a story that will stay with the reader long after they finish reading.  Make it terrifying,  make it memorable,  make it real.
